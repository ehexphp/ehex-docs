## Ehex or Simply EX.
is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries. EX lets you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.
More so, Ehex has similar functions and features with [_Laravel_](https://laravel.com), 
i.e, your experience with Laravel Blade and Eloquent Query Builder are still useful here, 
and that is one of the intention for the similarity.

## "Out of box" Features
Not only does this Framework solve problems like repetition of common codes to make Web development easier, but it also provides a lot of ready made complete features and tools Like : 

* Auto Database Table Creation (from Php Class extending Model1, Table Reset, Delete, Truncate, or Filled with Demo Data e.t.c )
* Html Quick Form Creator (with HtmlForm1 class )
* Blade layout (similar to laravel), 
* Eloquent Query
* Common Page and Backend code for Index page, Authentication(login, register, logout and delete account), Dashboard page e.t.c
* Util Class for different problems including String, Math, Array e.t.c 

## SIMPLE
Designed to be simple and powerful, no complicated artisan command or any command. Just Calls Designed functions. Ex. enables you to design a complete and professional website under few minute.

## EXTENSIBLE
Add powerful plugins or tweak the built-in codes to  fit your needs.

## MULTI-SITE
The ```__include/``` directory is the library and it could be moved outside your project for form multi-website. the ```__include/shared``` contains ```/resources``` and ```/app``` that could be shared amount other website using the same ```__includes.```


## Server Requirements
PHP version 7.0 or newer is recommended.
We would have love to make it work on lower version as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance issues, as well as missing features.
